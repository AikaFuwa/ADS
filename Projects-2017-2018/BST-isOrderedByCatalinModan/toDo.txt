-- to do list, based on code review
- rename "prototypes.h", a better name may be "bst.h"
- rename "implementation.cpp" with bst.cpp

- bst.h;// former prototypes.h
	- use only english for G_plaja_valori, nivel, etc. with better names
	- have a better order in function prototypes
	- why parameter name is root and later node? this is confusing
	- some coments about dunctions would help

-bst.cpp
		- variable names ... do not use root
		- english names ... not nivel
		
- Think about generating an input
- Think about running tests without reading data from stdin
