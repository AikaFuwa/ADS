At its core, the projects relies on the Binary Search Trees implementation. We trying to determine if all the values in our BST are bounded by a 2 values( a minimum and a maximum). In order to accomplish this goal, I have added few extra functions:
  1. A function which determines the minimum value of a given BST, that is "getMin". I have used a pointer to traverse the left branch of the BST and then return the minimum value. 
  2. A function whch determines the maximum values of a given BST, taht is "getMax". The same as before, but the pointer traversed to the right this time and returned the maximum value.
  3. A function which generatres random numbers, that is "randomNumberGenerator". This function uses the built-in "rand" functions and returns the randomly generated value.
  4. Finally, the functions which performs the test is "checkValues". This is the core-function of our project. First off, it will check if the local minimum and maximum (defined as "global_minimum and" "global_maximum" in the code) are bounded by the values inserted by the user. If this first test passes, it checks if the node's data is bounded by those 2 values, if true it recursively goes left and right, if not it returns false and the execution of the function ends. If all the values which were checked recursively are indeed bounded by the 2 values, the function will return true.
